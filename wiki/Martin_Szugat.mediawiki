I used BioJava for the [http://www.bioweka.org BioWeka] project - this was my Bachelor thesis. For this project I needed a class that read [http://www.genome.jp/aaindex/ AAindex] files to analyze protein sequences using symbol properties. So I've contributed the <code>[http://www.bioservices.net/2005/10/aaindexstreamreader-for-biojava.html AAIndexStreamReader]</code> class to the BioJava project. Another contributions is the <code>[http://www.bioservices.net/2005/10/biojava-externalprocess-class.html ExternalProcess]</code> class which is helpful if you like to execute an external program multiple times and read/write its output/input without using the filesystem but within multiple threads. Finally, I'm helping to get this Wiki online ...

More information about me and my work (e.g. on XML, .NET and Bioinformatics) can be found on my [http://szugat.gmxhome.de homepage] or just google for [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22Martin+Szugat%22 Martin Szugat].
