== How Do I Count the Residues in a Sequence? ==

Counting the residues in a Sequence is a fairly standard bioinformatics task. Generally you would construct an array of ints and use some arbitrary indexing system. Better yet you could use an AlphabetIndex to impose a standardized index. You would get one from the AlphabetManager using one of its getAlphabetIndex() methods. Because this type of activity is so standard BioJava conveniently wraps up all the indexing etc into a class called IndexedCount which is an implementation of the Count interface.

The following program reads some type of sequence file and counts the residues, printing the results to STDOUT. Note that this program will not cope with ambiguity symbols. If you want to count ambiguity symbols you need add a partial count for each Symbol that makes up the ambiguity If this is the case you would use this solution.
