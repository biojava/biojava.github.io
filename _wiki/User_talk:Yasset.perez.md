Hi, I want to know if it is possible to load the information of the
protein of the FasTA or Swissprot format and filter by taxonomy. I want
to read a file and filter this file by taxonomy or other characteristic
and the I want to calculate the mas of the protein sequence and
ordering.? In the documentation I read some methods to do that but
serveral of them are Deprecated. Thanks in advance. Yasset
