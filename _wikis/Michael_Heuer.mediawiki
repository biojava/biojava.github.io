Michael Heuer is a long-time Biojava lurker and a rare contributor. Half-baked ideas and unfinished implementations of things that may make it into Biojava at some point can be found at his personal development site, dishevelled. org (http://dishevelled.org/).

Michael presented Biojava at BOSC 2005, Biojava spinoff project StAX (http://stax.sf.net) in a lightning talk at BOSC 2005, and will be presenting Biojava at BOSC 2008.  See [[BOSC2008_Abstract]].

Links to the actual presentions will be added here and elsewhere on the wiki when I can find them.
