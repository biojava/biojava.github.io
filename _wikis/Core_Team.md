The so-called Core developers are the project leaders who ensure that
releases are made, try and ensure that unanswered questions are
addressed, and set a vision for the project where appropriate.

Alumni

These gurus laboured tirelessly as core developers in the early days of
BioJava. Many are only semi-retired and still lurk on the mailing list.
Occasionaly their oracular wisdom can be heard permeating the AEthers of
the web.

Becoming a Core Developer
-------------------------

Generally a person is asked to join the Core development team after
showing significant leadership and contribution to the project. A core
developer is an individual willing to take on the responsibilities of
timely code releases, answering questions from users and developers on
the Mailing list, and generally setting a vision for the project. If you
feel yourself or other individuals have shown themselves to be a
dedicated developer to the project and that they should be part of the
leadership team, please email a current Core developer.
